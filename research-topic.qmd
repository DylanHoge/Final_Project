5. Ideas About the Type of Data or Potential Datasets

National Election Studies (NES) Data: This dataset contains information on demographic factors (including race, gender, education, and income) along with political affiliation, and is one of the best resources for understanding voting behavior.

Census Data (American Community Survey): The U.S. Census provides detailed demographic data (race, gender, income, education level) and could be used to look at general population trends in political affiliation.

Pew Research Center Surveys: Pew frequently conducts political surveys that include demographic information and political preferences. These could be valuable for analyzing the influence of socio-economic factors on party affiliation.

Exit Polls Data: Exit poll data from national elections can provide insights into how different demographic groups voted in relation to party affiliation.

State-Specific Polls or Surveys: Some states conduct their own voter surveys that provide data on political affiliation and demographic characteristics, which could be used for more localized studies.
